# Stage 3: Group per day

**Split the data area to show a group per day**.

The time entries for each day should be shown using the **Table control from Fluent 9**.

The columns should be **project, date, value, milestone and name**.
Don't add the column "Duration" to the time entry table.

The time entries tables height inside groups should be enough to show all the records from that day, without scrolling.

The table header should have **colorBrandBackground2** as a background color.

The day groups should be at least 200px height. 

The data area should be scrollable, so that the user can scroll through the day groups.

Keep everything else unchanged.
