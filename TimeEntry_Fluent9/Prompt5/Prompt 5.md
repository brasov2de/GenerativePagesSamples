# Stage 4: Drag & Drop
Add another column right in front of the time entry tables with a width of 40px. Use the **ReOrderDotsVerticalFilled**  for those cells. 
When this cell is dragged, implement a **drag and drop to move the row to the drop target day group**, and save the record on the target day.

Dragging in this cell, won't affect the editable implementation.
Keep everything else unchanged.
