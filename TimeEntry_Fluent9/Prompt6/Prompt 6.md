# Stage 5:  Statistics

Inside the Statistics area, add a gallery with all days of the month, and the sum of the values of my time entries for each day. The days should be **ordered by columns for each week day, starting with Monday**.

Show the days in bold and aligned on top of each tiles, while the sums should be shown below each day, and smaller.

A click on a day inside the Statistics, should change the week filter on the week of the picked day. The rest of the filter behavior stays the same.

When a time entry is saved, refresh the Statistics gallery on the right side too.


Use the **attached image** for the design of the Statistics tiles.

Keep the filter DayTile unchanged.
