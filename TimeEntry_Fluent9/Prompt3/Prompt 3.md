# Filter area:

The weeks should always start on Monday. 
The day tiles on the filter area should cover the complete width of the filter area.
The tile is showing the **day** and the **sum of the TimeEntry value** column for that day, using the design like in the **attached image** DayTile.png.


When a day in the selected week filter is clicked, open the Dialog  already implemented for the edit functionality, to allow the creation on the picked date.
